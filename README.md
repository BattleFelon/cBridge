cBridge

A simple wooden bridge analysis program using SFML and Opencv to process video and highlight stress areas

Dependencies:

 -Opencv 3.10
 -SFML 2.32 
 -SFGUI 0.2.3.0

Program processes video data comparing a chosen frame to all others. By having a black background behind a video of a bridge while inder a being tested the program can highlight changes to imnage in red, which allows impercivable changes to be made visible. This can help in the teaching of stress and strain in a class where this activity is done.

Working on Linux Builds at the moment. cMake should work on most systems
